# Opening Issues

Issues are always a common way of outlining where improvements to a project can be made. They give developers tasks to complete, and oftentimes end up drastically improving the quality-of-life of the repository for everyone. 

When opening an issue, please be sure to follow the provided issue templates. Be sure to follow the guidelines outlined here.

- [Be Clear and Comprehensive](#Be-Clear-and-Comprehensive)
- [Amicability Gets Results](#Amicability-Gets-Results)
- [What if my issue doesn't fit into a template?](#What-if-my-issue-doesn't-fit-into-a-template?)
    - [Request/Create a new template](#Request/Create-a-new-template)
    - [Create an issue without a template](#Create-an-issue-without-a-template)

## Be Clear and Comprehensive
format your issue in an easy-to-comprehend way. We're all human here, nothing's perfect -- but that doesn't mean you should talk in caveman speak because "few word work well".

~~We're Java developers, expect verbosity~~ Please provide all the relevant details right away or immediately on request.

## Amicability Gets Results
In short, **be nice**. If you can hold a mature, productive conversation with an understanding tone and be receptive to feedback, you'll do just fine! I expect all sides of a conversation to be professional -- starting drama is absolutely childish, embarrassing, and will likely result in you being temporarily or permanently **banned** from the project.

## What if my issue doesn't fit into a template?
If your issue does not fit into any of the provided templates, you can do one of the following:

### Request/Create a new template
Sometimes there are topics so common that they can and should be turned into a separate template. That's perfectly ok -- the needs of a repository are not simply constrained to whatever measures are currently in place.

### Create an issue without a template
Other times, the question is too specific to not warrant a separate template, and it doesn't fit into the templates either. That's ok too! Once again, the needs of a repository are not constrained to whatever measures are currently in place.

If you plan on doing this, please be sure to format your issue in an easily-understandable format. You can even use templates from other repositories -- nothing wrong with stealing ideas. As long as you provide the information needed, things will usually work out.
