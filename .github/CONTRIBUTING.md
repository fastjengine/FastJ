ðŸŽ‰ To begin, thank you for considering contributing to FastJ! ðŸŽ‰

This project has been growing well on its own, but with the addition of new features and enhancements we're going to need to work together as much as possible. Without you all, this project really wouldn't be possible. Once more, thank you! ^^
