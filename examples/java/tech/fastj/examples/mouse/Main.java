         * - Mouse#isOnScreen: check whether the mouse is within the game window.
         * - Mouse#isMouseButtonPressed: check whether the specified mouse button is held down.
         * - Mouse#getMouseLocation: gets the mouse's coordinate location on the screen.
         * - Mouse#getButtonLastPressed/Released/Clicked: gets the mouse button that was last pressed/released/clicked.
         * - Mouse#getScrollDirection: gets the direction of the mouse wheel's last scroll (up or down).
         *
         * To demonstrate these, I've added the following:
         * - If statement to check if the right mouse button is pressed
         * - If statement to check if the mouse wheel was scrolled upward (less than 0), and by how much
         * - If statement to check if the mouse was released while on a "button" (the Polygon2D object)
         *
         * Notes:
         * - The MouseAction class defines several types of mouse actions (pressed, released, moved, etc).
         * - The MouseButtons class defines a few buttons that are very commonly found on mice -- the left, right, and
         * middle mouse buttons. */
