     * A behavior:
     * - Is any class that implements the Behavior interface
     * - can be attached to any GameObject
     * - has instances, allowing behaviors to be used more than one GameObject at a time
     * - provides methods to control game objects through SimpleManager/Scene initialization
     *   and updating */

     * what makes up the behavior. */

     * Behavior just to have it constantly transform an object.
     *
     * There are three predefined behaviors:
     * - Behavior.simpleTranslation -- constantly translates a game object by the amount specified
     * - Behavior.simpleRotation -- constantly rotates a game object by the amount specified
     * - Behavior.simpleScale -- constantly scales a game object by the amount specified
