     * engine defaults to a 1280*720 window. This is part of FastJEngine's default
     * configuration.
     *
     * With that said, let's get started with the first two types of configuration:
     * 1. configureViewerResolution
     * 2. configureInternalResolution
     *
     * Note 1: Both of these configurations require use of a Point. A Point is similar to that
     * of a Pointf, but it only allows integer values.
     * Note 2: Configurations should always be done after initializing the game engine.
     */

    /* "FastJEngine#configureViewerResolution" configures the viewer resolution -- the size of
     * the window that the player plays in.
     * By default, this is configured to 720p -- 1280*720. Of course, you can change this to
     * any set of values you would like, as long as both values are at least 1.
     *
     * For this example, I've set it to 640*480. Feel free to mess around with the numbers! */

     * of the actual game canvas (where the game gets rendered).
     * By default, this is also configured to 720p -- 1280*720. Like the viewer resolution,
     * this can be set to any values that are at least 1.
     *

    /* Now, we'll move onto configureHardwareAcceleration.
     * By making use of java2d, FastJ supports a few hardware-accelerated graphics APIs:
     * - OpenGL, for devices of all OSes
     * - Direct3D, for Windows devices
     * - X11, for Linux devices
     * As well as CPURender, for software rendering.
     *
     * With that in mind, "FastJEngine#configureHardwareAcceleration" allows you to configure
     * the type of hardware acceleration your game uses. This is set using the "HWAccel" enum.
     *
     * For this example, we're going to set the hardware acceleration to OpenGL. */

    /* Lastly, FPS and UPS configuration.
     *
     * - FPS: Frames Per Second (how many times the game renders to the screen in a second)
     * - UPS: Updates Per Second (how many times the game updates in a second)
     *
     * FPS can be configured with "FastJEngine#setTargetFPS".
     * UPS can be configured with "FastJEngine#setTargetUPS".
     *
     * FPS defaults to the refresh rate of your default monitor -- check your monitor's specifications to determine
     * what this value is. On the other hand, UPS defaults to 60. */
