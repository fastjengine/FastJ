    /* Keyboard controls in FastJ can be achieved through a few different methods.
     * - Creating a KeyboardActionListener to do actions when a key is pressed/released/etc
     *     - key listeners can be added to the manager at any time. With that said, most use cases would add the
     *       listener when the game is being loaded.
     * - Polling the Keyboard class directly for key state
     *     - This tactic works best in methods called often -- such as the update method.
     *
     * For this example, we'll work with the KeyboardActionListener in the init method, and working with polling in
     * the update method. */

    /* KeyboardActionListener */

    /* The KeyboardActionListener class is designed to set up actions depending on keyboard actions from the player.
     * It has 4 main methods:
     *
     * - onKeyDown: this method is called when a key is held down.
     * - onKeyRecentlyPressed: this method is called when a key is first pressed.
     * - onKeyReleased: this method is called when a key is released.
     * - onKeyTyped: this method is called when a key is typed -- first pressed or held down.
     *
     * To demonstrate each method, I've chosen to log whenever any of the methods is called. Run the program to see
     * this in action. */

     *
     * - Keyboard#isKeyDown: check whether a key is held down.
     * - Keyboard#isKeyRecentlyPressed: check whether a key was recently pressed.
     * - Keyboard#isKeyRecentlyReleased: check whether a key was recently released.
     * - Keyboard#getLastKeyPressed: get the string representation of the last key pressed.
     *
     * To demonstrate each of these, I've added if statements to check if the key "W" is held, pressed, released, or is the last key pressed.
     * Furthermore, I've added if statements to demonstrate the following:
     * - the left shift key is held down
     * - the right control key is recently pressed
     * - the numpad 4 key is recently released
     *
     * The Keys class represents the possible keys on the keyboard -- it's what we use to specify keys we want to check the state of.
     * Make sure to use it when checking for a key's state.
